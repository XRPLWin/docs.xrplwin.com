# How it works?

## NFT selection

When you first open xApp an lookup query goes to fetch list of your NFTs on XRPL. List then renders on your screeen.

Additional metadata from CDN servers are then overlayed over pulled NFTs including NFT image and title. List is fully searchable by metadata title.

Press on NFT you wish to burn to select it, then details will be displayed on screen: Meta image, Meta title, NFTokenID, Issuer, Collection and Serial number.
